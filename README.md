# node_v3.0_sdk
Uses older version of Optimizely Node SDK with more descriptive logs - for troubleshooting purposes only.

To use, clone/download the repository & run `npm instal`. Modify the datafile URL and add API calls as needed. 

The implementation is based mostly on docs/recommendations for v2.x SDK: https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/v2.1/docs
